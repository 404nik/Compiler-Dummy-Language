# COL226: Programming Languages

Welcome to the repository for the course COL226: Programming Languages. This repository contains all the assignments for the course, designed to give you hands-on experience with various programming paradigms and concepts.

## Course Overview

This course covers a broad range of topics in programming languages, including:

- Value and state-oriented paradigms
- Translation
- Syntax and semantics of programming languages
- Operational and natural semantics of functional and imperative languages
- Data abstractions and control constructs
- Block-structure and scope
- Principles of abstraction, qualification, and correspondence
- Parameter passing mechanisms
- Runtime structure and operating environment
- Practical and implementation issues in run-time systems and environments
- Abstract machines
- Features of functional and imperative languages
- Untyped and simply-typed Lambda calculus
- Type systems for programming languages, including simple types and polymorphism
- Objects, classes, and inheritance in object-oriented languages
- Interactive programming and interfaces

The laboratory activities in this course involve building various small interpreters for core languages in different paradigms. Tools such as lex and yacc are introduced for front-end analysis.
